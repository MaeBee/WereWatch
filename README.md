# WereWatch
A The Elder Scrolls Online werewolf stop watch to see who's getting the best runs!

Features:
* Timer UI element that will count up and auto-hide after turning Human again. Can be moved around and will save position
* Chat notification that will state the (most accurate) total time between changes.
* Best time tracking

Comes with a / command, /ww, to manage debugging aspects of the addon:
* "/ww show" force-shows the UI element to allow positioning
* "/ww hide" force-hides it again
* "/ww start" force-starts the clock
* "/ww stop" force-stops the clock, with chat notification
* "/ww pos" outputs the current position of the UI element to chat
* "/ww best" outputs the current best time to chat

Future plans include an implementation of LibAddonMenu for full customisation options and other enhancements.
